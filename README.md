SUVNET22 MMORPG spel av Omar, Khaled och Robert!

## Requirements for playing: Docker and .NET SDK (unless you use the release version you don't need .NET SDK)
Clarification, if you install the release version you only need Docker.

How to play (from cloning):
 - Start the docker service in docker-compose.yml (this is our database the game needs to be running)
 - Start the game by either using terminal 'dotnet run' within the MainProgram directory or using your IDE to run MainProgram. (without installing only cloning code)

How to play (with release version):
 - Start the docker service in docker-compose.yml (this is our database the game needs to be running)
 - You can download the release version here https://github.com/KhaledZra/ProjectX/releases/tag/v1.0
 - run the MainProgram.exe
