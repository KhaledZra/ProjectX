SUVNET22 MMORPG spel av Omar, Khaled och Robert!

## Requirements for playing: Docker and .NET SDK (unless you use the release version you don't need .NET SDK)
There currently is no release version so both parts are neccesary :(

How to play:
 - Start the docker service in docker-compose.yml (this is our database the game needs to be running)
 - Start the game by either using terminal 'dotnet run' within the MainProgram directory or using your IDE to run MainProgram
 - You can download here https://github.com/KhaledZra/ProjectX/releases/tag/v1.0
